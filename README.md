Face Expression Detection is a project aimed at detecting facial expressions using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. This repository provides an implementation of a deep learning model for accurately recognizing facial expressions in images or video frames.

## Features

- Detects multiple facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear, and neutral.
- Works with both images and real-time video streams.
- Lightweight and efficient model for fast inference.
- Easy-to-use API for integration into your own applications.
